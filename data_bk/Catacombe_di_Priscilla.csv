"Extremely interesting place to visit- 40,000 catacombs- not crowded at all - small tours - quite an eerie experience!!! English speaking tour guide who was very informative and passionate about the subject. Small gift shop but no cafe nearby be warned! Take water/drink with you. Fantastic original historical experience- would definitely recommend a visit."
My students and I had a wonderful time at the Catacombs of Priscilla. I had never been but it was an amazing experience.
"This is an interesting place, but really not much to see. We were a little disappointed. Whatever you do, don’t take a tour of this through City Wonders - it was a huge disappointment."
"We reserved a time before our trip to Rome, but upon arrival there were many people waiting for the tour. Needless to say, the group seemed rather large to navigate the underground cemetery. The history behind the catacombs is fascinating. You actually walk through the underground tombs, which is something I can say I have never done. With all my research however, I wish I would of sought out the other known Catacombes in the area, as I was hoping to see the church known for its unique ""decorating"" style.."
"Was easy enough to reach from the metro station, a fairly easy 10 to 15 minute walk with Google Maps. The attendant sold me a ticket to the English-speaking tour.The guide was quite informative, yet I was disappointed when he said the Vatican had advised us not to take photos. Whether it was out of respect I had no idea, but I didn't think it was warranted as we were not disrespecting the deceased at any time. I would've accepted taking photos without flash.It's quite a unique place, the frescoes inside were nice, and it was interesting to see where many bodies were kept, but some of it became repetitive, and the fact that almost everything of value had been removed and some areas appeared to be under renovation made it a bit unremarkable.Maybe I've been spoilt by visiting the bone church just outside Prague, but I expected more evidence of its history."
"Want to learn more about the roman catacombs? This is a guided tour (can’t go down on your own) with lots of explanations. When you arrive, they will tell you what time is the next tour either in Italian or in English. The temperature is cool, take extra layers. Bus 23 took me right back downtown."
"The Priscilla's catacombe itself is very interesting, out of crowds. We are not English native speakers but we both work in Englisk speaking environment. Unfortunately the ""english speaking"" guide, spoke by English, that nobody understood. He spoke very quickly and was in a hurry during the whole tour. The visitors in our group were just confusingly look at each other and the quide was constantly saying excuses for his English. We regreted, we didn't wait 25 min. for a good speaking english guide, that we met with another group at the exit."
I don’t understand why this is not one of the top visited places in Rome. You have to visit this place. Very big down in the ground and lots of history to learn from. Kids love things like this.
It’s a little hard to get to but worth the effort. The English tour was very informative. Be aware that it is closed from noon until 2:00.
"In researching which of the Roman catacombs to visit, those of Priscilla seemed the most fascinating, and we were not disappointed. They are easy to reach via a short bus trip from central Rome ( a bit far to walk), and the reasonably priced guided tours are very regular. There were only six of us for our tour, which was perfect. No photos are allowed, but that’s fine, as the memories are worthy. There’s a small shop in the building selling associated literature, pictures and trinkets. And finally, if you are Catholic it’s a ‘must see’ as it contains the oldest known image of the Virgin Mary."
"I thought I would be visiting catacombs resembling those in Paris, far from the case. Due to visitors removing ""souvenirs"" , so there is not much to see, it was somewhat interesting none the less."
Unfortunately photos are not allowed but the tour was amazing. Our guide was very knowledgeable and the whole experience was very good and informative. It only took 30 mins and cost 8 euros person. The gift shop is also very good. I totally recommend it.
It was a very unique experience to imagine so many deadbodies all lying at one place as exhibits. However now there are only cavities where they were once stored. But the place is like 8 storied deep and we are shown around by a guide...More

Taking the tour in English was very important for our understanding of the catacombs. To see frescoes from over 1700 years ago was amazing. No pictures or video was permitted. The attached picture is a postcard.
Enjoyed the guided tour & back story on features of the catacombs. Located very near to other major historical sites in Rome. Wish photos were permitted.
"This was such a great decision to visit. The tour was very interesting, and the guide was very informative. I would certainly recommend this tour, well worth the trip."
"We had an excellent guide giving us all the relevant information. She was very detailed in all her explanations explaining why the catacombs were where they were, how they were built and the reason for some having churches etc."
"Thank you very much for your review, we always try to do our best!"

Thank you for your feedback! It's very important for us.
this was a pretty good experience. According to our guide they are still finding these catacombs. There is about 7 miles of tunnels if I remember correctly. Lots of history in these. Don't go if your claustrophobic it gets kinda tight in places.
"Dear Dylan, thank you for your feedback. In fact, there are centuries of history, art and faith in our catacombs!"
It was really great! The guide was patient and very professional! We enjoyed the tour. Highly recommended
Thank you for your visit and your opinion. We are glad to know that you enjoyed the tour.

"This was a great, inexpensive tour to take. Lots of things to see and our guide was very informative. Kind of creepy and cold down there. We really enjoyed it!"
This is the gem of catacomb tours in Rome! The first fresco of the Virgin Mary by the early Christians is here. Really awesome and more primitive (less touristy) than other catacombs.

"They haven't changed anything here annd that's l. Our guide was a real historian, very knowledgeable and interesting. A real place, untouched and not glamorous. You feel like you're back in time, hundreds of years ago. Probably not appropriate for young children."
Better than expected as my knowledge proved to be faulty. There are complete chapels down there with plaster painted as marble like Renaissance work. It's not like the catacomb stuff I learnt at school which was apparently wrong. A good guide enhanced the tour. A...More
"The Catacombs of Priscilla are located in the convent of the Benedictine Sisters of Priscilla, on Via Salaria, a short bus ride from the historic center. The site, like many catacombs in Rome, is fascinating. The catacombs are vast, but you see a small, poorly...More"
We had a guide for the English tour that was not a native language speaker and I think this limited what we took away from the experience. I'm sure she was very knowledgable but grasped to explain many details. Also our group was way too...More

"What a lovely surprise. While in Rome our group wanted to see some of the ancient catacombs, unfortunately most had been booked out. The concierge at the hotel suggested we could go and visit the relatively unknown (to us anyway) Priscilla Catacombs. On arrival we...More"
"We had to choose between the Priscilla Catacombs and the ones along the Appian Way, and selected these because of time constraints. No regrets at all. These catacombs were among the most interesting things that I found in Roma. Our guide seemed a bit rushed,...More"
"We visited the Catacombs of St. Priscilla with a group of about 30 pilgrims from the United States. The number of graves and the sheer size of the catacombs is hard to comprehend. As all burial was mandated to be outside of the city proper,...More"
"This place was something else and the guide was actually very knowledgable of the place and its history. Depending on who you tour guide is, there are sections that you may/may not get to visit. I noticed there was another tour alongside us, and there...More"
"We were able to view the catacombs after the site was closed to the public for the day. The sense of time and history is overwhelming. The input from our guide, Georgia, with a company called Love Holiday, was a difference maker in our understanding...More"

"These catacombs were only opened quite recently, and are not on the main tourist trail (yet). Access is controlled by a small community of nuns, but tours are directed by lay guides. The groups are small and the pace relaxed.
Getting there is something else!...More"
"This catacombs are truly worth it even if they are a bit far from the center. The guide was quite informative and we only shared the tour with another couple, which made it more enjoyable. Just amazing! I would put this as a must see...More"
We chose this one to visit because it isn't as commercialized as the other options. A 1/2 hour city bus ride from central Rome dropped us near the church. We had an informative walk through with an English speaking guide who was a bit eerie...More

Needed to ride a bus from downtown Rome. See Rick Steves' tour book. The ride itself was neat because it goes through some regular non-touristy areas. Tour was about 30 minutes and was in English. It is all underground. Catacombs are very different from those...More

"We went to these catacombs instead of the more famous ones because Rick Steves said they were less visited. Alas, our visit coincided with several large groups of teenaged students. We were given a description of the catacombs to read in English, then herded along...More"
The 310 bus from termini was very convenient to get us there. I recommend it. Much of the tour was not in English but they had a handout that was helpful.

"We so enjoyed taking the 30-minute tour in these catacombs. Rick Steves recommends them because he says they're ""intimate, like catacombs should be"".... And I think he's right. The entrance is not grand, nor is the small lobby area, but when you take the tour,...More"
