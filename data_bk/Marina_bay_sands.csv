Well worth a visit whilst in Singapore...took the option to use the bar as recommended by other reviews and enjoy a cold drink mostly paid for out of your entrance cost.
"Wanted to visit this place and it does not disappoint!! You pay 23SGD to go up to 56th floor which has the viewing gallery and it‚Äôs breath taking.
The infinity pool is for guests only.
Surrounding shops are amazing and food court impressive!"
"Great to spend time with family (except for casino off course).
Infinity pool is also excellent. Especially love the bedroom."
The view is spectacular you see all of Singapore and because it‚Äôs a main attraction is very busy where you have to que for a bit of time preferable to visit at night .
"Last time we visited Singapore, this hotel complex was half built. It is unique as there are three hotels with a rooftop garden joining them all together, with a large overhang at one end. We decided we would go up there when it was completed. The lift up to the top was quite reasonable in cost. When you arrive at the top there are gardens, bars, restaurants and a pool for hotel guests only. The views are amazing, you look out all over Singapore ‚Ä¶ easily seeing the Merlion Statue, Gardens by the Bay, The Sky-wheel and the incredible Singapore skyline. Do make the effort to go up here, you'll not regret it. "
"Meet our older children in Singapore for a holiday. Ideal spot as inbetween UK where they are and Australia where we currently are. Worried a little about how we would fill the days, we had been told Singapore was quiet. This was a great place, we stayed on the viewing platform for several hours and they got the obligatory selfie/instagram shots. Would recommend, we even experienced the storms and rain from up there and it was spectacular."
"A great experience, great way to see the Singapore skyline at night.We paid for tickets to the Skypark and had a beer on the deck $14 a beer in a plastic cup? Does cost to go up but is worth it for the view, thought the light show would be a bit better than it was, the music from the bar drowns out the music from the light show. Go early if you want to get a position near the rails to see the light show it does get a bit busy."
They do warn you when buying tickets that the roof access fee of SGD23 per person only gives access to non-residents to a small area of the top deck. It‚Äôs the big to one end which sticks out unsupported (or so it looks) which isn‚Äôt something did anyone with vertigo!Once you‚Äôve taken in the view on both sides - city and Marina Gardens there‚Äôs nothing else to do. So a quick visit.
"Compared to other options. You do get a nice view, but not worth the money. Other attractions offer more for a smaller fee / no fee"
Went for an afternoon drink and wasn't disappointed. The view is second to none. I had a very well prepared GinTonic and some snacks. It's pricy but it's still cheaper than going to the observation deck.
"This place has everything! Shopping, eating, drinking, casino, and views of Marina Bay. Stay low on the promenade for the nightly laser light show. Go up to the skypark for dinner or drinks and breathtaking views! My favorite was watching the sunset."
So well worth the effort and the fee. The 360 degree view at 57 stories up is to be seen to be believed. Enormous building and engineering marvel. How is it possible. Buy tickets from below ground at the marina bay sands at the SkyPark...More
Tour group with the visit covering a walkway to view Singapore. Not a great deal. Would like to have seen more of the garden area.
Going to the 57th floor is fantastic for the view and the bar/restaurant. Very romantic. The night skyline was wonderful and there were fireworks in the bay as well. It would be great to stay at the hotel in order to get access to the...More
"Good place to explore magnificent views from the top of 57 floor.. This should be done for sure when u r on Singapore tour..
Views are really great and offers opportunity to look at entire Singapore from the top.."
Singapore is well known for all its shoppingcenters but this one is really beautiful. At the bottom of the centre there‚Äô this ledfloor where children can play on and it also has nice toystores. Downstairs there‚Äô also a foodcourt. It‚Äôs a very expensive shoppingarea but...More
"Great views, breezy weather, whats not to light, the position and height with the best views in town. A must if you're visiting Singapore. Better if you're guest at the hotel, the infinity pool is awesome!"
"View is nice but a little pricey, there are other ways to see the skyline for cheaper. However this does give you a very nice view of almost the whole area. Very hot to go during the day - hard to enjoy in the blazing...More"
"Definitely take a stroll up here! I‚Äôd recommend it to view the whole city. Drinks are awesome and so is food. It‚Äôs worth it while in Singapore. More pricey, but worth it."
Have a bird eye view of Singapore while enjoying a meal at the restaurant. You may even have a dip in the infinite pool and admire the 360¬∞ view of the vibrant city.
"My family and I had lunch in 'Marina Bay Sands Skypark', it was Excellent. I loved it, the buffet was delicious, it had a lot of variety of food. Even the kids were quiet thanks to the food from different countries! After that, we went...More"
"It is a place to have a wide and high view of Singapore. Well, the admission fee is too high and the place there is not so much things to do."
Surprising view seen infront of kids pool. Kudus to the servers walking around to ask every single guest a drink despite under the sun. üëç
"the highest hotel in this town. worth to visit and take a lot photos to share to everyone. jika anda ingin menikmati swimming pool nya, anda harus membayar lagi. tetapi jika hanya ingin menikmati pemandangan dan sightseeing tempat ini free enter."
"Amazing experience and cleanliness, staff are very helpful. Once you have your tickets the staff guide you all the way to the top"
Don‚Äôt miss the Marina Bay Sands when in Singapore. The view from the platform on the top is spectacular. You can see all of the city from the top.
"The views are great, the food is mediocre and the drinks are expensive. $22SG for a pint of Stella Artois? I've never paid that much anywhere in the world."
"This is an unbeatable view of Singapore, especially at night. So worth the trip up. You can walk around both sides of the top but just at one end. Weekends nights are crowded. There are dining options on top but overpriced and mediocre IMO."
"57 floors up you get to see Singapore from high above.
I would recommend visting at night, the city lights and laser show are simply stunning, well worth the entry fee."
We chose to do this activity in the afternoon. The sun was high in the sky as we took our turn around the wheel. The price was reasonable and the full circle around took approx 30 minutes to complete. There is a commentary as you...More
"An experience that wasn't that cheap but if you want a great overall view of the city of Singapore, it isn't to be missed."
Spectacular views from level 57 of the marina bay sands. City and ocean views as far as your eye can see. Great photo opportunities and you can also have a meal and drink at Ci la vie a restaurant that is located at the site.
"We really enjoyed this - a little expensive but for us, we had no line to wait in and probably around 20 people on the platform so very different to other reviews. As a result we had plenty time to take in the view (slightly...More"

$20 sgd gains you access the roof top terrace but not the pool. But you can offset this entry cost by having a drink at the bar at the top - so essentially a free drink.
"This was worth a visit, a amazing view of the Maria Bay. Such a great land mark for Singapore. Would highly recommend to pay to visit the viewing platform."

"Marina Bay Sands is an amazing building, it just stands out. View the whole City from the sky deck. Night time is very good, unfortunately had showers when we went up. Cloud covered the area but still nice. Ticket was S $23"
"Nice place ! Up before the sunshine to see the town with the sun and after during the night. You could not see the garden because it's reserve for the hotel. So, ilt's only for the view on the Singapore."
"Very nice view to watch the sunset and the sunrise. However, it is very crowded at some period of times, so try to come earlier to enjoy the place."
An incredible building of the World. A definite box ticker. About $26 to go up. There is a bar and restaurant on top (apparently very expensive) however the bar is free I understand and would be great view at night.
"Go by night and travel to the top - tickets cost 23 Singapore dollars but the view is fab with all the city lights and overlooking the harbour, the gardens etc, A restaurant bar is situated on the top"

"A gravity-defying experience with amazing views. The viewing deck is 70+ floors high and is glass- perimitwtsx for a full-view experience.

"A hotel three towered and on top of it a horizontal structure which is having several trees plants and restaurants.
A real feast for eyes.
Although we did not go inside but it is definitely looks great."
"I didn‚Äôt actually stay here, but was able to tour the hotel/casino pretty extensively before and after dinner at the rooftop Lavo restaurant. It‚Äôs an absolute marvel of architecture and should be considered a ‚Äúmust see‚Äù during any visit to Singapore."
Attended while on a quick stop over. Bought the voucher option to attend the pool deck which includes $20 worth of vouchers but be warned: the costs on the menu for drinks do not include a service charge. The drinks seem a bit weak.
Very expensive rip off! You would be better off going on the Singapore Fly (still a rip off) but at least you get a bit of a ride and commentary. Granted the view from Marina Bay is awesome but way overpriced like everyrhing in Singapore....More
"Amazing views of the city! It costs 20 S$ but you can redeem this at the top for a drink or some food, well worth the visit, spectacular views of the city in all directions!"

The views from the rooms over the harbor are breathtaking to see all the vessels. Restaurants variety and quality are first class. Pool complex one of a kind and direct access into the gardens which are a must visit. Staff very helpful
"We visited SkyPark first time when we stayed at Marina Bay Sand. Beautiful hotel and facilities.
The view is excellent and the restaurants/bar up there are good places to hang out"
Oh my god it's really amazing place. We will come back. We really enjoyed with my family members. We saw the water lighting show. It's really nice.
A perfect area to take a close up picture with MBS and some other attractions such as Gardens by the bay.
It's one of those places one should visit if you find yourself in Singapore. It offers a full 360 view of the city
We had the best the views was totally amazing seeing everything around. The harbour with all the different vessels then the other side. Well worth going .
This skypark is located on 60th floor of marina Bay from where you can have a look at entire Singapore. The view from Skypark is breathtaking

"With its infinity pool, a cool bar and spectacular view...one can only say WOW! This is certainly a place to see when visiting Singapore."
"Instead of paying Aus$23 to go to the skypark, go to the foyer pay Aus$20 to go up to the bar. You will receive $20 credit to be used on a drink. Same view and you can sit down and enjoy a drink."
The Marina Bay sands is a work of art in its construction and the amenities within. Excellent service whether for hotel stay or for restaurant guests. Passers by will also enjoy the sculpture and paintings carefully selected to decorate its hallways and rooms.
You hear so much about Marina Sands that we were itching to get up there to see what all the fuss was about. We paid $23 each but that also gave us $20 credit at the bars at the top so cost was very good...More
"Going up to the rooftop is either via restaurant pre-reservations or advance payment to be used in restaurant/bars or a fee for the observation deck area. Depending on which, the views are different."

"It is the only way to see Singapore from up high...WOW...stunning. I am sure it would be lovely during the day but we went at night and it was amazing. Another attraction you would not want to miss if you visit Singapore, worth every cent."
We were totally thrilled and overwhelmed with our experience at the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. There can hardly be a better view anywhere in the world. This is an unmissable experience.

"It was really a structure that Singapore can boost to the world, a symbol of happiness, prosperity and competitiveness."
Visit to sky park is worth a visit. You reach ground floor to 56th Floor in 36 seconds. The view over Singapore is stunning. It‚Äôs 23 Singapore dollars to do it. But for the views alone it‚Äôs worth it.
A good view of Singapore you can see for miles and get good over view of the city they take a photo of you on a green screen then photo shop it 80 dollars not worth it just take pictures yourself
The view of an evening is just beautiful on a clear night. The lights over the city and Gardens By The Bay are amazing.
"Went on Sunday evening. Huge queues and wasted a lot of time. The Observation deck has fast elevators.Finally, the view was spectacular especially the Gardens by the Bay. which was unique. Price of entry, food, photo etc was high. However, the experience is worth it."

Wow what a experience well worth it! The views were amazing!"

MBS is the most visited and happening place in Singapore these days. The skypark view point is at 56th Floor and has a ticketed entry around 23$. But its worth visiting as the views are spectacular. If you visit this then Singapore Flayer can be...More
