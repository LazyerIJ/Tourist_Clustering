Comment,
Fe (Felicity) was the best guide I have ever had along with great information with such wonderful enthusiasm. All guides should be like her !,
"I have seen thousands of pictures of the Colosseum from every angle, but until you enter it, you just don't understand. We had a walking tour of the area which was well worth it to get some detailed explanations about the history, would highly recommend a tour. ",
"very interesting place to vist unsure what I was to expect but it was crowded busy and full of people trying to sell you stuff ,just see attraction but we didn't spend more the 30 mins there",
We were lucky enough to take the night time tour which meant very low crowds. That’s unusual for summer. Loved the underground area at dusk. Can’t say how the day tour would be but I heard the summer crowds can mean long lines. The difference in the day and night tour is the night tour skips the top floor. The less than 1 hour is for night. I can’t speak for the high volume day tours.,
"This has always been one of the many sites on my ""bucket list"", and it did not disappoint. We arrived early, so the crowds weren't a problem. The size of the coliseum and the architectural feat to accomplish this at that period in history is nothing short of amazing.",
This place is amazing. But make sure you have a front of line tour/ticket as it is very busy. Have good walking shoes.,
Our tour guide kept constant count of the group and ensured all went through the security areas as a group. He was kind and friendly. He took photos for anyone who needed group shots. Our guide knew his history and shared a lot of historical facts which made the tour in the heat much more enjoyable. We felt safe and informed. He knew where to go and ensured we kept as a group without pestering from vendors or other tour groups. The Skip the Line was worth it. The regular line had a 2 hour wait period. ,
"Awesome historical place. Better to get skip the line tour, the guides were very informative and you font miss out on anything important. Our kids and us parents really enjoyed the wonderful visit!!",
"2 stations away from Termini..if youre not so tired, its a 10 min walk from Termini ..best to check at night",
After lots of research and lots of warnings about how busy the sight gets (understandable given it is one of the most famous places in the world) we decided to pay over the odds for a night tour. There were 25 of us in the group and only one other group in the Colleseum (but at the other side). It was spectacular. You find yourself imagining what it must have felt like being both a spectator or a gladiator in a world almost unimaginably different to now. Our guide (an archaeologist for the Collosseum) was very engaging and informative and able to answer all our questions. if you do one thing in Rome visit this wonderful sight at night. ,
Much less crowded—we only saw one other our group. Not as hot as during the day. And it was really cool to see the Colosseum as the sun was setting.,
The colosseum was everything that it was advertised to be. We had a guided tour and Valeria was our guide. She was terrific about giving us as much information as she could while still allowing us time to take pictures and enjoy the atmosphere. The...More,

I was so happy to see the colosseum. i wanted to get some knowledge through my walk around. However the charts are so scanty. I believe unfortunately the trip needs tour guide.,

My wife and I decided to go to the Colosseum while on a recent trip to Rome. It was absolutely beautiful to see. We did not take a tour but did walk around it. We had considered skipping it but are thrilled we did not!!!,
Important place to be at when in Rome. If you are Gladiotors fan then will feel little bit nostalgic and will try to connect the dots (which may be futile as that's Picture lot of imagination). :-),
I cant choose if its more amazing day or night!Its a fantastic monument you must see by yourself and explore!,
