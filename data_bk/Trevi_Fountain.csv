"Beautiful fountain and building. However the high season and selfie shooters are ruining nowadays so many places with artificial smiles. 

This was my second time here, but it lacks some wow-effect like Colosseum or St. Peter‚Äôs Church has.

A must see place, but maybe evening...More"
One of the must see attractions in Rome for a photo and toss a coin and make a wish. Early in the day and you can get a photo without the tourists.
The fountain is impressive especially when you see it for the first time as my kids did. Unfortunately the place became so crowded that you can no longer enjoy yourself.
The fountain is stunning and so ornate. I think that is a must see thing in Rome even if it is just for a ten or fifteen minute stop. It is busy all day so i don't think it is worth your while getting up...More

Go in the afternoon to see the full effect I also understand it's beautiful at night. 
Don't touch the water there are fountain police...More"
Best to be enjoyed after 2am üòÅ. Very busy on a small square with everyone trying to throw coin. Water is tiffany blue very beautifull.
it was realy crowded but you can't be in rome without be in the trevi fountain. throwing a coin in the fountain garantees your return to rome.

"One word stunning, simply stunning you have to see this, it will take your breath away, it appears to be tucked down one of the side streets unbelievable."
"Yes there are crowds, yes there are vendors, yes it is a bit hectic there, but it is still very impressive.  We went during the day and then went back to see it lit up on another night.  Must see."
beautiful fountian is a must see if you vist rome I would recommend going in the evening when the crowds die down ! buy some gelato and sit beside the fountain
"The first time we visited Rome, the fountain was being used for a fashion shoot so could not get close. This time, we visited early in the morning (around 7.30) - highly recommended before the crowds move in. Whilst a spectacular fountain, almost as enjoyable...More"
We had long walk on the way here since we dont have a tour guide..i suggest to check the nearest metro stop to avoid the long walk
Been to it a few times in the past but first since was cleaned. Beautiful structure and was so lovely in the full sun that day. It‚Äôs a 15 min walk from the barberini metro stn. As always busy but you always get a space...More
"We were so psyched about seeing Trevi Fountain, but it was a disappointment.  The stone carvings are cool, but the fountain is small.  Honestly I think that the fountain at Kings Island amusement park is a lot more impressive, just not as old."
"It was next to impossible to get close to this beautiful creation due to the crowds, but I would definitely recommend going to it.  We went during the day and at night and I think night time is beautiful.  Ir's definitely a must see.  One...More"
The fountain and surrounding area were recently refurbished.  It looks nearly brand new.  It is most impressive at night

One of the most place that I visit in Rome. Magic atmosfere.  Water is clear. The sound of water. But you must visit by night for a beautiful see!
"Ignore all the crowds and admire this beautiful fountain, watch for pickpockets though, don‚Äôt forget to toss a coin in to ensure that you will return.....wonderful !!!"
"The fountain is beautiful and I'd recommend going at night when it's all lit up. But, it is so overcrowded. You also can't move anywhere without someone trying to sell you something, it just ruins the atmosphere slightly."
"I live the Trevi fountain but the crowds during the day & evening are insane, go early in the morning. We were there at 6am much better view and could take photos without all the other people."
"We did visit it day and night, both times were pretty crowded but still worth the visit. People just hang around , sit around and enjoy the scenery.  3 days in Rome is plenty to visit most popular sites."
Viewing the fountain I could image the work that when into creating  such a massive piece of art.  The most amazing fountain I think I have ever seen.
"Really busy any time of the day ,pestered by sellers ,a must to see in Rome ,very very hot when we visited."
This is once in a lifetime experience! The place is always crowded with people from all walks of life. Who can blame them? This is simply beyond beautiful!

"Another place on my list of places to visit, apart from the tourists, of which there was a very large amount, it was well worth the walk to get here, plus there are plenty of places to eat....and drink."

"For me the most beautiful thing to see when visiting Rome. Always my starting point, a coin toss and a wish :) 
Yes it's crowded, yes it's noisy, but take some time to enjoy the beautiful fountain, the number of coins in it :)"
Probably the most famous fountain in Rome. The speciality of this fountain is that its built against a wall full of doors windows  unlike others which are built in a square. The structure is massive and beautiful. The turquoise water makes it even more spectacular....More
"Visited while in Rome.  We were walking near there anyway. Would recommend looking up the meaning of the sculpted scene. Tells an interesting story. 
It's famous because it appeared in a few movies.  
People say that travelers should see it, that it's a ""must-see"" when...More"
"My wife's wish to visit this fountain was due to the Spanish/Argentenian  movie ""Fred and Elsa'.  It is spectacular but extremely packed with people.  We could not get enought of it; visited three times while in Rome.  Worth it each time!"
"As I'm sure you're well aware, this simply must be seen at night. This imposing fountain is gorgeous and should be seen from all angles, if your time permits. Just one of Bernini's many masterpieces, it's a can't miss when in Rome. Be sure to...More"

We stayed near the Trevi Fountain and walked past it in the different time of day and always enjoyed beauty of that part of Rome."

"What a magnificent fountain, you could stay and look at it forever except for the very rude and continuously pushy illegal salesmen who are relentless and really spoil the attraction.  How many times do you have to say ‚Äòno thanks‚Äô before they leave you alone?...More"
I could have spent all day and night at this site - it‚Äôs in such an unassuming place like many of Rome‚Äôs truly special places. There is something magical about the fountains.
We visited twice in the afternoon when it can be very busy but you still get to throw your coin. And then we went early morning where it is being emptied very quiet.
"Great in the day, great at night. It‚Äôs one of those places which for some reason is much better than it should be. Great selfie opportunity."
"We arrived just as night was drawing in, the lights came on and I was transfixed. Very busy but you can see why. You cannot visit Rome and not see it."
"We stayed near the Trevi Fountain and walked past here several times a day while sightseeing. This is a must-see in Rome and in my opinion it's best to visit in the morning, before the hordes of people show up."
"May be it is because we visited Rome in July and on a very hot day, but the piazza around the Fountain was absolutely overcrowded. It took away the possibility to really take in the magnificence of the attraction. We stopped a few minutes and...More"
"The old saying is if you throw a coin in you will return. It‚Äôs true. We were here in 1998 and I threw a coin in. Well, we did return. Beautiful area of Rome."
Enjoyed seeing this on our walking tour.  On a hot summer day it was loaded with tourists...because of the size of the crowd we didn't stay long.  Keep your valuables and money close...I had no issue with pickpockets but they are there believe me.  Don't...More
"Yes you must see the Trevi Fountain at least once but be prepared for massive crowds especially in the peak touring hours.
Be aware of peddlers and pickpocketers. 
Best to be there early in the morning to avoid all the chaos.!"
"When in Rome you must try to see the iconic Trevi fountain. It‚Äôs been in movies, travel shows and you should throw a coin in it yourself! It may be crowded but you really need to see it"
"Trevi Fountain, full of music, sites and people from all over the world..  Plenty of security, so no concerns....  Eat, drink, shop and enjoy...  Take many pictures.."
Me and my boyfriend thought we would pass this on the way to the Vatican (as we had a early tour booked) it was so quiet! We probably arrived at the fountain around 8:30 and there was not many people. We went back later on...More
This is our second visit and definitely noticed the difference coming in July! It was heaving!! It is still stunning though. Even saw a bride and groom coming to throw a coin into the fountain! Worth visiting by day and night. Try to visit early...More

Not far from where we stayed 10 minute walk, it was an amazing thing to see that they had the ability to built something like that so long ago."

I visited this place Alone

My lower than expected rating is due solely to our visit taking place in the summer.  Friends of mine visiting Rome for the first time with us were barely able to get to sit immediately next to the fountain while some other sat in those...More
It was an amazing experience to see this both day and night. But whatever time you go its sooooo busy! Its difficult to get pictures close up as everyone is there for the same reason but otherwise a must see
"Definitely the place to go when in Rome. Very crowded and the adults are very disrespectful towards children, would not bring them to the lower section."
The best of the world. The fountain with the most visited spot in Town of Roma. Great architectural symbol and nice to revisit each Time we come to Roma
"This fountain is truly amazing, but what kind of ruins it is the amount of people trying to snap a selfie."
"Trevi Fountain was made famous in the 1952 film, 'Roman Holiday' with Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn, you remember, 'Three Coins in the Fountain'

A must see in Rome.  We went about 5 pm and it was quite crowded still.  The signs posted made it easy to find on our walk from the Pantheon
"Was in Italy 23 years ago, and the fountain was beautiful. Now it is littered with garbage and a mob scene, as are other places in Rome. Place has declined. Will not be returning. Unless you want to see water bottles on the ground, paper,...More"
In July you have to fight to get to the fountain edge.  There must have been 2000 people around it and very hot.
Crowded but a popular tourist attraction. Easy self directed tours. Security was present and very visible. Fountain offers many photo opportunities.
"Trevi Fountain itself is beautiful, however, it is in a very small place. It would look much more enormous if it was located in a bigger place, e.g. in Piazza Navona :)"
"This is a very beautiful and magical fountain, there is always a crowd...but it does add to the excitement of standing in front of history. Visit through the day, but make sure you go back at night, you wont be disappointed."
"Crowded, but worth seeing the Roman icon. And lots of good shops, gelato and cannoli to be had while you are visiting."
"The Trevi is a classic stop on any visit to Rome and one of the world's most famous fountains.  Built on the side of the Palazzo Poli, the more than 250 year old statues in the fountain are beautiful following the restoration completed in 2015,...More"
Definitely worth the walk to see this at night. Incredibly packed with tourists but the art and sculpture and size of this fountain is a wonder. This doesn‚Äôt require a long time commitment.

"Highly recommend visiting this ,nice photos taken and people very considerate when taking photos ,moving out of the way making room for others"
It isn't a fountain - its more a river pouring from a building. And it is constantly surrounded by a sea of humanity and street hawkers. The best time to be here is before 7.30 in the morning (as with most of Rome) because then...More
"Granted, it was crowded, but if you stay back a little and just enjoy the fountain it is lovely. This and the Pantheon were my favorite sites in Rome!"
This is located in an area accessible primarily by walking.  It‚Äôs beauty is taken away by the crowds and crammed alleys leading to it in July.

Beautiful fountain and plaza which wasn't too far away from my hotel. Some good shopping in this area as well.
Get here early because it gets meggga busy:) part of the tourist route it‚Äôs worth a look. Then disappear down another quiet backstreet :)
"I love going by the fountain and dropping a few coins. 
Ice cream place next to the fountain doesn‚Äôt disappoint either!
At night it‚Äôs a lot less crowded and is worth seeing when it‚Äôs all lit up."
"We decided to get up early and visit the fountains, this was for 2 reason. The summer heat in Italy and humidity means during the day it can be mid 30s. Also early morning it is generally quieter around all the sites.

This place is so crouded and busy but worth the wait to get a good view. An amazing fountain with beautiful sculptures.

What a true work of art. Beautiful breathtaking etc. We saw it in the evening with the lights and the people it was a great experience
"Much larger than seen in pictures. Go early in the morning or late evening. Lots of tourists during the day. Huge crowds. It can get hot, but well worth it. Please read up on the history of the fountain as there no descriptions on site."

"The beautiful fountain of Trevi is so beautiful. Unfortunately everyone thinks the same, so the place is very crowded. Throw a coin into the fountain and hopefully you‚Äôll come back to the eternal city."
"This is worth a look but is seriously crowded and a playground for pickpockets. Opposite the fountain there is a clothing store where, from the second floor window, you can get a good view of the whole fountain."

The Trevi Fountain is beautiful but very crowded. Couldn‚Äôt really get near the front. Beautiful statues and Roman architecture. Very hot in June but still a must-see.

A fantastic fountain right in the heart of Rome. Experience is spoilt by the crowds which are there day and night. Don't forget to throw a coin into the fountain to ensure you will return to Rome
This was the most crowded thing we saw in Rome. I am talking shoulder to shoulder all around at least 10 people deep.
"We were pleasantly surprised that in early June, the crowd was very manageable.  Last time we saw it, the crowds were awful even though it was under rehab."
"Loads of tourists, cannot see a thing. Africans running around, trying to sell stuff, not taking no for an answer."
Avery must for everyone the fountain is absolutely amazing not to be missed but please be aware it's very conjested and beware pickpockets are rife
"Definitely and without a doubt a must see when you are in Rome! Also the streets around it offer a lot of good places to enjoy some ice or have great dinners!!

I definitely recommend getting a hotel/Airbnb at walking distance from the Trevi Fountain....More"
Whoa!!!!   We were there at around 1:00 and it was cray-zee crowded!  Not enjoyable with the heat and 3 kiddos.  Next time we‚Äôll opt for a night time view.
Looking at Trevi fountain can be quite soothing for your eyes while having a cup of coffee but avoid this place in peak tourist season as your view will be hindered by the crowd indulged in clicking pictures of it

We made this a quick stop while walking to many sites.  So crowded....watch your purse.  There are places to sit and watch for a nice break.  The fountain is magnificent.
"While this may be a lovely fountain, it‚Äôs hard to tell with the hoardes of people packed around it. I preferred spending my time at the numerous other sites in Rome that weren‚Äôt overly crowded."
Try to visit late at night or early in the morning to avoid the crowds.  It IS beautiful but you might be too overwhelmed and not have a good impression of this beautiful work of art if it's too crowded.
Had to go back since the last time we were in Rome it was under construction. The fountain itself is so pretty but with the crowd and all it makes you want to leave as soon as you throw your coins or take your picture....More

We came here twice in our short weekend in Rome.Once in the day and the other in the night and it is mindblowing and beautiful.You must see it for yourself to really appreciate it.
"Beautiful, no doubt about it. A lot of people, yes. Keep on mind while walking here from via de corso, that there a lot of rose and hat and this&that sellers as well pickpocketers. This was only place where I   saw really pushy counterfeit sellers."
"It's a Rome essential, but is it still worth visiting in 2018?

Yes actually - it's fresh from a three-year face lift and is as bright as its ever been. The azure water and white stone makes for an amazing sigh.

Is it still busy?...More"

"Whilst a very interesting attraction, it is very over-crowded as it is a focal point for tourists. Not necessarily a place I would visit again."
"Its hard to get a picture here without someone or the other being part of it! Overall a nice stroll, though it gets very busy."

"We experienced the fountain at night only.  It was approximately 9:30 at night and was gorgeous all lit up.  I will say it was very crowded even at that time.  However, even with the crowds, you can get close enough to take a few pictures...More"
"This was a nice and free stroll through history.  It was smaller than I believed, but was worth the time to visit."

This area with the. Thousands of visitors requires a massive clean up. The stench of urine was disgusting cigarette butts every where I was shocked.

It seems the Trevi Fountain is always packed with tourists but it's very easy to understand why. It's absolutely splendid (and even more beautiful when lit up at night) and an absolute must for any traveller (or even local) visiting Rome.
Hugely overcrowded on the day we visited and a lot of security but it is still spectacular! The children loved throwing the coin in the fountain! Amazing knowing the water comes from the old Roman sources

Best fountain in the world. Very crowded (and hot) during the day. Suggest going at night to avoid the crowds that also allure pickpockets.
There are over 300 water fountains all over Rome. So instead of buying water for about ‚Ç¨3 to ‚Ç¨5. You can just take your own water bottle in this boiling weather and fill it up with fresh mountain water.

This is a lively area to visit.  So beautiful and historic.  The energy is so positive and it is close to many other attractions and shopping.
