"This was another of the many sites I felt were a ""must see"" while in Rome.  It was a pretty awe-inspiring site to see.  Many structures still standing.  The overall scope of the place must have been a sight to see in ancient Rome!"
Very interesting and so much in there. Enter via the forum then do palatine hill to end up at colosseum to avoid the biggest queues.
"The highlight of our trip to Rome, the forum was just amazing. We hadn’t planned to go but after walking down to the Colosseum and seeing how vast it was we were drawn in. There was so much to see we were there for three...More"

No line to get in! Walk up the palatine  hill and then check out old Rome! This was such an unexpected experience! Better than the colosseum .
"Dripping with history, the Forum is a walk worth an hour of your time , Don't miss Julius Caesars funerary temple or drinking from the ancient water fountains"
A short walk between ruins of old Rome. I find a problem to reach charts to read information about the place. Charts are so scanty in general in rome.
we combined roman forum with coloseum walking tour.This area consists of several ruins and indepth history.
"One of the best Roman sites, every corner or ruin can be discovered with centuries of history about people or famous battles for the Roman Republic or Emperor. Better with a guide."
The Forum is so full of history and interesting ruins around each corner. The fact that the ticket is linked to the colosseum tickets is excellent. In particular the fact you can use them on two consecutive days is a major bonus. We were too...More
"The only thing more ""Rome"" than the Forum is the colosseum.  A great complex of ruins and buildings, a must do for Rome."
"The Roman forum is a must-see when visiting Rome.  It is a chance to walk through history.  Set between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills, the Roman forum was once the heart of the Roman Empire - where victory marches were held, where speeches were given,...More"
We spent over four hours touring these ruins.    So much history mixed in with the new.    A must see.   Get the Roma pass and skip the lines
"A sprawling ""monument"" from Ancient Rome, with endless structures, temples, wells and gardens to behold. If your schedule permits, a guide (in-person, audio, etc) would be worthwhile as there are centuries of stories here. A very cool experience to walk on ancient cobblestones, to walk...More"

"Take one of the skip the line guided tours, worth every penny! Try to go early morning, it is HOT in Rome in July!!!"
Wonderful experience!  So much better with an amazing guide. He also showed us computer graphics of what the buildings looked like back in the day. Great visit.
"You cannot walk among the artefacts, but the view from the side gives you everything. Wonderful history."
"We bought our combo ticket - Colosseum, Forum, Palatine Hill - a day ahead of time at a ticket office down the Via Gregorio, where the lines are very short and then skipped the long lines at the attractions themselves. We also downloaded the Rick...More"
I wouldn’t attempt this without a tour guide either. There is so much to see and learn here and having someone with some knowledge on the area adds so much more to the experience!
"The history staring you in the face here is unbelievable. The arches, churches, ruins and archeology digs taking place are incredible.  Worth booking a tour to get the most out of it though."
Climb the Palatine Hill to the side of the Roman Forum to get an astounding view of the whole site. Excellent visit and a good way to walk back towards the centre after the Colosseum.
Beautiful. It gets very hot during the day. Not many shaded places. I strongly recommend hats and sunscreen and water. Very safe . Purchase tickets in advance and save long waits. I would also recommend reading up on the history or pay for a guide.
"Regrettably, we didn't explore the forum in as much depth as we could have. After wandering the Colosseum, the forum and Palatine Hill were somewhat daunting. However, I would recommend making time to see at least some of this old, historical architecture."
The Forum can be visited with your Coliseum ticket along with Palatine Hill. There is a lot of history and ruins here to explore but as far as the Forum itself it took us awhile to locate it as there is not much there to...More
"This place, which has well-preserved ancient Roman ruins, will only be valuable if you know the history it represents, either through a guide or through the informative boards presents everywhere in that area. 
An amazing place to visit."

"If you like Roman, you like history and you like seeing relics this is definitely one to visit.  Some quite magnificent things to see."
Wonderful experience visiting this old place in Rome. It is realy good to have a guide so that you can understand the meaning of the different places and buildings
"Our guide was very smart, and therefore, we saw Palatine  Hill first, and had a wonderful outlook and discussion of what we were lookin down upon, while  seeing from above.  By this time in the hot day, we were satisfied !!"
part of our Colosseum tour which shouldn't be missed but make sure you pay the extra for the guide . Well worth the expense and very informative.
If your into history this is the place to see! This is where Rome was first built!  I would recommend a tour guide who can explain to you what each ruin was and why it was built. Bring plenty of water and wear comfortable shoes!...More
Was amazing by each and every ruin on this site. Highly suggest to get the audio guide to learn all about Rome's history and understand the story of these gems!
"Definitely worth a visit when in Rome, make sure you have a drink to take with you and good walking shoes. Plenty of water taps around to refill your water bottles"
This was a real treasure in the heart of Rome. It was very well preserved and the experience was enhanced with a guide to explain the site. There was almost no shade so a hat and suncream are a must.  It was an excellent site...More
The Roman Forum is a best stop for anyone who loves the ancient history! I would recommend a tour guide because there is lots to see!
"This place was really something amazing! You could feel the history as soon as you walk in! It was super hot, so I recommend water and a hat if you're going in the summer months but overall worth it to see this site!"
"Huge columns, massive pillars - everything is big big BIG! VERY interesting site - located right next to the Colosseum. It was a perfect continuation afterwards."
Interesting but more could be done with the area. We didn’t realise you could get an audio tour until we saw signs with headphones and numbers and would have liked to have had additional information about the site as we went around.
We had a guided tour for the Roman Forum and I highly recommend this as you get so much more information and history and tour guide was excellent with a lovely sense of humour.  A must see when visiting Rome.
Beautiful. Your pictures will do it no justice. you really have to experience it in person. Drinks lots of water during the summer.
"This visit can be done just after the Colosseum (it is next to it). I would suggest a guided tour as there are many ruins, buildings... from different period of Rome History and stories to be told."
Really interesting site which is well maintained in its current state. Signing good and informative.
We went with a tour guide. The group was only 30 people so it made it very nice. We learned so much. He helped us understand the 2000 years of history here. We enjoyed it so much that we’re taking another tour in two days.
"It was nice strolling through roman forum and looking at these historical buildings. Do note that the senator's building was closed for restoration, not too sure when it will be reopened. it is a huge place, so remember your sunblock and water while visiting in...More"
"If you enjoy historical sites, you can't do much better than the Forum. The preserved sites, spread out over well maintained grounds is amazing. You can feel the history oozing out of the ground.
Wear good walking shoes, you could spend hours roaming here."
We had a private guide which is great. The forum can be overwhelming with so much to see.  The guide helped us hit the highlights and the virtual reality was a fun addition.  The view from Palatine Hill is fantastic.
Views are spectacular.  Go on a tour to find out everything behind the history of this wonderful place - or you will miss out.  Real Rome Tours - fantastic...

My only regret is that we did not buy a tour as there is so much to the Forum and we had wished we had a tour so we could really have understood what we saw.

Absolutely fascinating and interesting place to visit. Remember to take water and be prepared for a hot visit as not much shade but when you see the history it is well worth it.
If you love history you need to allocate at least half a day to this and Palantine Hill which you can access with one ticket.  You feel like to have been dropped into history and can walk around forever seeing it in action here.
Definitely do a tour or use the audio guide or you will miss all the history that you are walking upon!

Beautiful place! And this is were history happend. So much to see and read about if you’r in to this kind of stuff. Even if you’r not its still impressive. Dont take the entrence next to Coloseum or from the Capitolium. Huge lines! Just 100something...More
A must see in Rome.  Pack comfortable shoes; the grounds were dusty in the summer and relatively uneven.

You can see this and the colosseum on a combined ticket and this wasn't even on my radar.  It's amazing and vast- you could explore these ruins for days.  I enjoyed it a lot.
Did this as part of a tour with the Colosseum and Palatine hill. The sheer scale of it shows the beautiful detail of Roman history. Take lots of water as there isn't much shade.
"Једна од локација коју морате видети. Заправо, у Риму се ништа не мора, али кад наиђете на локалитет не можете да само прођете поред њега. Припремите удобну обућу, фотоапарате и будите спремни да свако мало ""шкљоцате"" како би сте забележили историју која је овде веома...More"

We actually stumbled on the Forum while walking along the Palatine Hill and looking for an exit. :)  The ruins are amazing and you can get right up close to them...and the exit is just past them. It's such an amazing historical site.
"This area is interesting and beautiful, but there are so many things to see in Rome, I wouldn't necessarily walk through unless you have a specific interest in these ruins.  You can see a beautiful view from Palantine Hill or other surrounding elevated spots."
"The Roman forum is definitely worth a visit! I would recommend paying to have a formal guide take you round so that you hear every detail possible. 

It is so astonishing that it feels like you are on a film set. It looks unreal."
Great to feel part of the history that has happened here. You must keep hydrated although there is a drinking fountain with clean water. Great to top up your bottles!

Learning about this historical area was the highlight of our vacation. Just seeing the ancient ruins in learning about the history of Rome was amazing. Hard to Believe how long some of those rooms have been standing. It just makes you want to stand and...More
Really enjoyed walking around this site very interesting and enjoyable. Probably stayed around here for an hour lots of ruins to see . Couple of restrooms for people to use too. Plus the odd weer fountain too great when the sun is out as not...More

"This was an interesting experience.  Great if you like ancient architecture and archaeology.  It can be kind of hot in the summer time though.  Also, be aware that there are many scammers (ignore anyone that tries to initiate a conversation with you) on the path...More"
We had a tour guide explaining the significance of the ruins here which made them more interesting. You can see the temple spot where Julius Caesar's body was burned. There is a plaque out front yet the information is in italian.
"We were given a tour of this area, and as.a person who loves history this was a dream come true for me. While standing there and being given the history of the area you really feel like you have gone back in time. We would...More"
"Make sure to do a tour of the Colloseum, Palestine Hill and Roman Forum through Walks of Italy. These three sites are a must see!!!"
We walked round the Roman Forum as part of our Colosseum ticket. It's just amazing to walk on the same footpaths and touch the same coloums that some of the greatest men in history have been. A couple of toilet's no shops selling water. Lots...More

"Such an amazing place to walk round. Very interesting. Great views of the colosseum & typewriter.
The tickets we booked for the colosseum also gained us access & the queues were not long."

"Great place, full of history but wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking lots! Good view of colosseum"
After much excavating the Forum was the city center of Rome.  Many temples to all different gods where here as well as trading and shopping for the towns people.  After many year temple where converted to churches.  They keep finding more and more under layer...More
The walk beside the forum is littered with the foundations of history. It is not true that all roads lead to Rome - but definitely that all roads leave from Rome
If it hadnt of been for our lovely tour guide from City Wonders I would not have appreciated the Forum half as much. There is a lot of history and stories waiting to be told - make sure you have someone to tell you them!
This was a real highlight of the Coloseum/Forum/Paletine Hill.  This is just amazing that this is still standing.  My oldest son (17) said that this was his favorite spot.  There is a fountain toward the entrance so that you can fill your water bottle too...More

"The numerous examples of roman architecture and culture are impressive. But when the significance and roles of the various structures are explained more fully by a guide, the forum becomes a fascinating place. The remains of temples, palaces, public spaces, government buildings, and arches show...More"
Each ancient site has signs in English and Italian that explain the site being observed. I recommend doing this just after the colosseum early in the morning for the best experience and minimal crowd levels.
Loved exploring the Roman Forum. Our trip was enhanced by using a free audio tour on the Rick Steves Audio Europe app. So much great information. You need about an hour or hour and a half for a cursory visit of this site.
Absolutely superb. packed full of history. make sure you take plenty of drinks if visiting on a hot day because its very exposed to the sun
"We purchased a tour from Viator. Great price, great tour guide. Filled with so much rich history. I highly recommend do early it gets so hot. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable about the history and showed us pictures of what it use to look...More"

This is what my visit was all about a fantastic site for photography you can visualise what life was like in the days of the eternal city. Hard on the feet but a worthwhile visit obtain a Roma card no queuing.

The Roman Forum is an expansive area across from the Colosseum. I would recommend spending around 3-4 hours walking around it. Wear comfortable shoes and bring water as we could only locate one vending area in the entire site. Make sure you explore all of...More
One of the highlights of visiting Rome. The atmosphere and sense of history here is unbelievable. Amazing vistas of Rome from different points within the area as well.
Simply delightful to stroll through the ruined remains of this once impressive market.  Sunscreen and comfortable shoes help!
"Nice open area to leisurely stroll and view the remains of an impressive civilaization.  No crowds.  Some spots offered shade and a seat, but these were rare."
"Your ticket for the Colosseum will give you access to the Roman Forum as well, so you can either go there first or after. We went after and it was very impressive. All the structure left is incredibly beautiful and you can really see how...More"
Walked thru the Forum right after the Colosseum at 3:30 pm. Not crowded at all.  We used the Rick Steve’s walking tour and that was a good hour of detail.
Rome is full of ruins but a walk through here is of interest particularly with a guide as they can explain the significance of some of the areas & give some of its history. We were told it was NOT the place where ceasar was...More
"The tour we did was attached to the Colosseum tour, which was 2 hours by itself.  So when you add the other 2 hours for the Roman Forum it makes it too long of a day.  Too much walking for our taste."
It’s full of history and definitely worth visiting if you have the time. Make sure you have some sort of guide. Either a audio guide or a tour guide. The Roman Forum won’t make much sense otherwise. We were able to download Rick Steves audio...More

"The Forum always amazes me. On this visit I actually walked amongst the old ruins, truly amazing how the Romans lived, and how modern ideas were implemented. Truly must be seen without rushing. I spent the whole day and will go again."
"The history with the Forum is amazing and breathtaking and just adds to the history to the beautiful city of Rome! 
A must to visit if you go to Rome"
Excellent Roman site but very busy and shade can be a struggle to find. Entry to museum is separate so make sure you get the right ticket.
An historical overload and with a knowledgeable guide you can feel the atmosphere and get the best form it. use the Paletine hill to enter and use this to also get  great overview of the Circus Maximus.
There were quite a few people queuing for here so go early. Walking in the steps of so many famous and infamous people was incredible. It is beautiful and staggering.
"Booked a guide before we arrived. Found the place a lot bigger than we expected. Glad we had the guide as very informative, he asked us for questions and he new all the answers. A must place to visit."
"At this site, you will be out in the elements, so if it is hot and sunny, make sure you have water and some protection from the sun. It's worth any discomfort to walk through the ruined temples and imagine all the history that went...More"
"The Roman Forum was grand. Great way to spend the afternoon wandering through the ancient streets of ""who's who in ancient Rome"". Don't miss the opportunity to stroll and take in the sights of the forum."
A great place to view the origins of Rome and the backbone of the city.  We drove around it in a golf cart (an excellent way to tour Rome) and enjoyed it very much.
We saw the Forum as part of our tour with The Roman Guy tour company.  Having a tour helped us to visualize what the Forum was and how it would have looked 2000 years ago.
So much history is here to see! Amazing to see all thise remains of old buildings and temples that used to make out the Roman Forum! Walked around there for at least a couple of hours and could easily walk for another hour and just...More
"Of course this is a must see.  It helps to view the area with an expert guide to appreciate the archeological significance of the adjoining ruins...the temples, the funeral pyre of Julius Caesar, the roads, arches."
This was our favorite part of the trip. It's beautiful and there's so much to see. Bring water as there is a lot of walking. There are vending machines as you walk upwards towards the garden but it's a hike so better to come prepared....More

"Interesting but don't need a guide except to skip the line. Our guide was knowledgeable, spoke good English and I would use tour company again. The Roman Guy"
"Although it is just ruins, it is well worth seeing. A guide is necessary to explain what you are seeing in historical perspective. He showed us a picture of what the Forum was thought to look like and it must have been spectacular."
"A stroll through historical Ancient Rome, this area has multiple temples and includes the area of Rome where men went to exchange ideas and debate. Another must see."
If you are seeing Rome for the first time you should plan a visit to Palentine Hill and the Roman forum. The price at the ticket office was 12 Euro. If you stroll around the Coloseum you will see the entrance on the back side...More

This place is truly amazingly Andy you don’t have to be into the history of Rome To appreciate the wonders you will see
Dont pass this up to just visit the colosseum. The sheer size of the place will take your breath away.  Plan to be there for about 2 hours even if you dont read every plate.
