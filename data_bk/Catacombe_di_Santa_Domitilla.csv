"As advertised, we saw a few bones here but overall not worth the trip or the price (8 euros) payable in cash only."
Great place hidden in Rome! Not too many tourists. Guide is included in the price (8€/person). He was funny and spoke really good english. We recommend this place to anyone interested in roman history and all things spooky and scary! (Sorry no pics as it wasn't allowed) 
I had an excellent guide in german language but nethertheless all can learn a lot about the history of rome
This place is dark and musty but very interesting. Wall frescoes and oil lamps help tell stories of long ago. Lots of steps and this place is not accessible by wheelchair. You must take a tour. Our guide was great! very informative. No photos allowed. They have a gift store and clean toilets.Easy to get to from Termini station in Rome: Take the 714 bus. Get off at Navigatori. Walk east for 10 minutes. On your right. Tour is in several languages and cost 8 euros.
Sabrina did such a good job giving my family the tour. It was lengthy but all rich of information. She really knew what she was talking about and kept the group engaged! I would really recommend this tour... it is different than all the touristy stuff that rome is known for so I'm really happy my mom signed us up to do this.
"It's quite interesting to go underground to see the ancient burial grounds. There are no bones to see just the empty graves. There are some interesting wall paintings. The small chapel underground is quite lovely. If you are claustrophobic, this may be troubling. I am & didn't realize how dark & narrow the tunnels were. I felt that I was having a panic attack, but saw several emergency exits. I calmed myself down, knowing I could escape, & managed to finish the tour. You can't take photos, but there was a very good book in the gift shop that highlighted what I saw. I would recommend if you like this sort of tour, but I wouldn't do it again. Our guide was very knowledgeable & friendly."
Take the tour here to become steeped in the ancient history of these amazing underground burials grounds.
"Friendly tour guide rushed us through approximately 400 feet of tunnels for €30 per person. No bones, no skeletons, nothing like you'd expect.Fun fact- you can catch a train to Pisa from Termini for €40, much less of a rip off, try do that instead.Picture- the one thing worth looking at in the catacombes, a painting on an empty crypt.1/10, dont bother wasting your money"
"Not what I expected, and all worth it. Newer site with unopened graves. Tour was very detailed and guide was extremely knowledgable."
"We had heard about the catacombs, but hadn't actually seen any pictures of them. So we definitely wanted to visit one of them. As we were staying in a hotel next to this one, this was a natural choice. The place was really amazing and the guide was very good. It is really a place worth visiting!"
"We visited the catacombs as part of a guided tour along with the Basilica de San clemente with The Roman Guy. We didn't really know what to expect before we got there, I just assumed there would be bones and skulls all over (It turns...More"
The guide was very detailed and the staff polite and helpful. The story behind is impressive though you shouldn’t expect to find as impressive sight: empty underground holes. However it’s worth visiting.
We headed down the A Line to San Giovanni in Laterano and completely fluked finding the 218 bus that would take us through the walls of Rome and along the Via Appia Antica to the Catacombs (once called the Queen of Roads it was started...More
There was no advice online stating its closed from 24 Jan to 21 Feb 2018. Went all the way there to see all 3 catacombs all closed. Such a disappointment.

"Above the ground, the entrance to the Catacombe di Santa Domitilla there are modern day buildings, streets and a garden. Below the ground there is a sunken 4th-century Chiesa di SS Nereus e Achilleus church/basilica and approximately 10.5 miles of catacombs. The Catacombe di Santa...More"

Easy taxi to and fro - interesting tour of the catacombs and visit to the underground church. Lots of detail in the talk presented extremely clearly by our guide Laura. Something different and cooler to do on a hot afternoon in Rome. Highly recommended.
"The surrounding catacombs of Saint Sebastian and others are more popular, but this is the one I chose because it's a little off the beaten track and was billed as the most creepy. It's was. It would be creepier if people didn't steal bones. Our...More"

"The Catacombe's were used by the Christians to bury their dead. This is definately something that you should see while you are in Rome, it is very interesting indeed."
We visited at the end of a long day so my opinion may be jaded. Not what I expected. The highlight was some frescos from the second century.

The St Sebastian Catacombs and Cathedral Tour was real unique but the tour was too short. Lots of information but you didn't get see much. The Cathedral was amazing.

This was the first stop on our tour and it was so fascinating to see the layers of history and see both Christian and the Pagan burial places and chambers. The frescos were in such good condition too. Totally confusing maze of tunnels..We were so...More
"- We visited the Catacombe di San Domitilla after visiting the nearby Catacombs of St. Callixtus first.
- The 30' visit of Catacombe di San Domitilla was certainly worthwhile if not impressive and the guide (compulsory, 8€) was good.
- In March 2015 at around...More"
went there with our company of 6 to alter a bit our city walks and see something different. First of all it outside the city centre. You will have to take the train the metro until fermata St.Giovanni and from there take the bus 218...More

"We found this a fascinating place to visit, and we hadn’t really planned to go. We had no idea what to expect. We asked the ticket seller whether we would just go in and look around ourselves - he must have thought we were crazy!...More"
Get in touch with the persecuted early Christian communities. Remember it was mainly slaves and women who were the first converts. A truly special place ... And you get to meet St Peter's daughter there too. Highly recommend for the history buff and pilgrim.
Took a tour around the largest of all catacombs in Rome. Thousands of Christians were buried here. Fascinating and very interesting.
"I would highly recommend this experience even to those who might be afraid of the ""underground"" nature of the catacombs. The passageways are wide and the ceilings high. We really liked learning about how and why they were created and maintained. It dispelled a lot...More"
"I learned about the Catacombs from my childhood friend who is going to be a priest. It is an eye opening experience to be so close with the early christians who were buried here. The catacomb is a four leveled complex with 150,000 bodies.

An amazing experience. Quite a small venue overground and because of its location I would guess its never that busy. You can only do the guided tour so your time there is quite fixed - approx 1 hour. Underground you cannot help but wonder at...More

"So five hundred thousand souls were buried here. Most of the remains have been removed. Old art work and chapels decorate the chambers.
We spent about one hour here, we took the guided tour. That is a must."
"It was a fast visit, but very interesting. You are not allowed to see the hole catacumba, and you can not make photos there. But as all tours are guided, you see how interesting is the place."
"We visited the catacombs as part of our Christian Rome Afternoon Tour. Honestly, I didn't think that these catacombs were necessarily as ""cool"" looking as the ones that we visited in Vienna, but there was a distinct historic significance in these catacombs that could not...More"

It was wonderful! We booked it online with Viator at the last moment and were SO glad we did so. Also included a tour of the Cappucin monks chapels.
"This was without a doubt the most astonishing afternoon I have ever spent sightseeing in Rome. The Vatican, by contrast, is a vulgar, overwrought display of imperialist Catholicism—This represents the true, humble faithful and their indomitable devotion to carrying out Christ's message. It is breathtaking...More"
The site was interesting but our tour guide didn't know the answers to about half of the guests questions. he also gave a little sermon at the end. I think it cost $12 Euros per person. It took about 30 minutes. I'd skip this catacomb...More
