"Just stunning. The beauty is extraordinary and since it is a church, it truly has spiritual value. Even with a thousand other people there it was unbelievably amazing. There is some signage, but for the most part you are left on your own to figure things out. The sign says modest dress and no pics but they weren’t enforcing that the day we went. "
Cool inside with the light coming from one solitary window at the top of the dome.No entrance fee. Nice square in front with a fountain.The place is massive and the dome is very impressive how on earth they built this all those many years ago...is beyond me. 
"Amazing history, true architecture wonder. Could not believe im standing in front of real building with so much history."
Is a must to visit Pantheon inside as only then you can understand how big and historical is. We have done same and we impressed a lot spending some of our time even if was too crowd. We also spend some time in the piazza in front of Pantheon in order to enjoy the street artists and relax with an ice cream (from Venchi).
"pantheon was the temple of all gods...in ancient rome as the greek word pan =all
theon=gods..means .on the wallks aroudn rome panteon it is a must visit site."
"Extremely impressive building pictures do not do it justice, definitely worth going to see, plus lots of bars and restaurants round this area, good value for money and excellent food."
The queues die down around lunch time and we walked straight in . It shuts early evening so it’s a daytime trip. Make sure you look up and dnjoy the buskers and street entertainers.
"I had no expectations of the Pantheon. It kind of surprises you when you come around the corner and it looks it's age from the outside, but prepare to be stunned when you get inside. I did not want to leave, I could have spent hours in there exploring and just taking it in. DO NOT MISS."
"Must see! While we were there Nov/Dec 2017, it was not that busy, even around 1130am. I wanted to go around lunchtime to try and capture the sun rays shining down inside the Pantheon. Unfortunately, there was too mucb overcast the day we went. However, this is an absolute must see. Even if there is a crowd waiting it moves pretty quickly. I do believe there is a cap off for the total amount of people that can be inside at one time(it's a large quantity.) No ticket purchase necessary, and I hope it takes everyone else's breath away like it did mine! I cannot believe the condition of this building is amazing as it is. Inside is 100% phenomenal, and larger than it seems in photographs. They were doing construction upkeep to the outside, but it never interfered with it's beauty. Small gifts/tokens can be purchased inside, while prayers, wishes, and hopes are made. There was a gentleman performing opera in the front when we exited(stunning!) There are local shops and cafes surrounding the perimeter. There is a deli(cant remember the name atm), when you exit to left(100% place to go!) Its been there and owned by the same family for almost 200 years. The Pantheon is dated B.C., and the history and construction is quite different than most other sites you will see. Be careful of the hustlers around the building with bracelets and tokens. They seem nice, but will try to con you, or worse."
"I honestly was in awe when I stepped into the Pantheon. The light shining down from the centre of the dome is really something you must see in person, it can't be captured in a photo. For artists there is a lot to see, including the remains of Raphael. While I went during peak season, I still didn't need to que and I had personal space inside, however, I recommend visiting at a less busy time, so many people making noise in a space that is supposed to be quiet does take away from the atmosphere a bit."
The Pantheon was crowded with tourists but that couldn’t spoil its amazing impact! The Romans built this nearly two thousand years ago and it’s still has a roof - with a hole for added interest. And Raphael is buried there!
"Loved the Pantheon. I enjoy historical landmarks and the art, craftsmanship are insane. And it was free."
One thing about Italy is that you will never be bored with the sights. This is one example. No modern technology in creating it and the detailing is so awesome up close. No talent was spared in the building of it. We went in the...More
This church was built in the first century AD and is pretty much in it's original form. The church has a hole on the top that allows quite a bit of light into the building.
The work that went into this place is just astonishing. The architecture is really beautiful. It was a nice atmosphere inside. I couldn't believe we were walking amongst Raphael's tomb. Just unreal.
"Another great place to visit. If there is a line outside, do not bother to wait around, go and see the other sites around and come back and you can walk right in. When we got there Sunday line was long, and we found out...More"

This is quite the most outstanding and unique building anywhere in the world to visit and marvel at it

"When one visits the Pantheon, one us humbled by the abilities of the Romans. An impressive architectural feat but doesn't take much time to see"
At last I visited the oldest Dome in the world. The dome is huge and presents roman technology to construct such building more than 1000 year ago
"This holy place is a beautiful place to visit. The line can be long, but the Pantheon is free of charge. We were lucky and got in really fast. Nice art and monuments inside"
"At roughly 1900 years old it is truly remarkable how well kept this building is. Its free to get in, however not much else going on here."
The Romans loved constructing all their buildings big and aesthetically beautiful. The Panthenon is no exception. Tip: Women need to cover their shoulders in order to get in.

There are little words to describe the stunning experience of walking into the Pantheon for the first time. Must see.
"We stumbled across this site and we were so glad we did. It was incredibly busy - we travelled Easter weekend and the queue was huge but it moved so quickly. Once inside, the calm was astounding. Worth a visit."

This was on my daughters bucket list and it did not disappoint. We had no line when we arrived about 5 pm. I do wish we organized a tour though as I am sure we missed a lot

"Definitely find time to go here. Also, the Piazza is loaded with plenty of places to eat, drink and people watch."

An architectural feat of its time. Beautiful inside. I would definitely try to see this if you have the time

Beautiful church with stunning architecture. Very busy when we went but it is free to go in which was great. Had a lovely drink at a restaurant just outside the church and listened to street performers playing music. A great few relaxing hours spent there.
One of the most impressive sights in Rome. Not a long walk from our hotel and good shopping in the area.
In the square you will find guides who will walk you around the surroundings and the pantheon for ten Euro’s. The pantheon is breathtaking. You feel like you are looking at a green screen it’s that unbelievable. This is one of the places you have...More

Great architecture but that is pretty much it. It is one of the icons of Rome but not the most beautiful church of the city.
The Pantheon is amazing in that you don’t have to completely use your imagination about what it would have looked like. It is amazingly preserved with unbelievable architecture. The piazza in front of the pantheon has wonderful musical artists and the admission is free.
Beautiful. Worth waiting in line. Read up on the history prior to going. Well worth it. Close to the Fontana di Trevi.

I visited the Pantheon in July 2016 and enjoyed the history of it all. Loads of people however ample opportunity to take some great photos. It is a very impressive structure.
It’s a good place to spend your time and knowing the Italian culture and the architecture of the Italy . There are lots of cafes and restaurants. You can really enjoy your cup of coffee by hearing the music .
"A lovely spot to visit, but can get very packed. Like the Vatican City, you need to cover your shoulders or knees or they won't allow you in 👋🏻"
Everything basically intact. Hard to believe it is 2000 years old! Definitely recommend a visit and great for all ages as no mobile phones meant to be used!
The Pantheon is free to visit and in the heart of Rome and is almost 2000 years old. The dome is huge and holds the record world's largest unreinforced concrete dome. Outside the atmosphere is great with live music and eateries.
"This was so cool to visit. You must have your shoulders covered to get in. The architecture and ceiling were so great. Also, NUNS started singing as we were touring. So cool. A must see when in Rome!"
Surprising and impressive in equal measure how the Pantheon now sits squeezed into a central Rome square. Worth visiting and some good chances for photos.
The pantheon is a popular place and easy to get into. You queue for about two minutes and you can walk in. You do need to cover your shoulders to get in. Inside it is quite an impressive building. The only downside is that no...More
Another amazing building within Rome. Raphaels tomb is within. Queue time very short when we went and is also free to go in and look around. Won't spend very long here but while your there worth popping in
well worth finding some time to go and take a look (especially as there's no admission charge) at this magnificent building.
Definitely go to see good architecture and to go inside and check out the tomb of Raphael. It is a must see if you come to Rome
"Had a wander around, it appears so much larger once inside. Later on a different day we had dinner in the piazza, lovely atmosphere"
"When you realise this building dates from 175ad it is amazing. The queue to get in is long but moves quickly, and it's free to get in. A must see if you visit Rome. And it's close to the Trevi fountain too."

Def worth a visit
Architecture was amazing, such detail.
Photos came out amazing."
Incredibly impressed with this sight in Rome. My son’s favorite spot after being here for three days. Read up on the history of the building before you visit!

"Very very interesting. Inside well organized with good history signage. Unusually had to cover up due to a special visitor but bought a scarf outside. By the Texas me we came out, for the visitor dignitary had left so all allowed in. It is beautiful,"
This is an easy and quick tour...so if you walk by and there are a lot of people trying to get in it moves quickly...So worth it!

you have to see it to believe it. Architecture beyond belief and still standing 2000 years later. How the built it is beyond my imagination.
You will be very surprised once inside by the size of that building. You must go inside and enjoy it!!
"The architecture was outstanding! It was so beautiful. It’s a great place to catch a bit of shade and also has an interesting history to read about.
If you’re in Rome you should really be there."
"C'mon, how many buildings with this age are still standing?
We caught it on a Sunday morning and they had service at 10:30am which is the next best thing to a Vatican Service.
Simply amazing!"
"This cultural icon lies at the heart of the eternal city. It’s a massive expression of Roman architecture. It’s free and easy to get into and enjoy. Outside, it’s surrounded by musicians, shops and cafes. Absolutely spectacular and a must see while you’re in Rome."
"Loved this place. I like the fact that it is free to access it, and the history behind it so impressive. Although, I would have like to have a tour guide."
The design is amazing. You really should try to see this in your lifetime. It is beautiful and historic.
Impressive and must see attraction. Be careful for the working time and check in advance. it usually closes 6pm on weekends. Last entrance in the weekdays is 7.15
Cant believe one of the most breathtaking sights of many in Rome is free. The divine light from the ocular is amazing every single time you visit.

"Put it on your list to visit - beautiful place, situated in a lovely, but crowded piazza - well worth it though"

We always wanted to visit the Pantheon. There is a small queue to get in- females make sure your shoulders are covered as they wont allow you in if your shoulders are bare. Inside the views are breathtaking. This visit is a must.

This is a must to see when in Rome......we did a quick 30 minute tour and it was wonderful. We learnt so much about the Pantheon that we never knew. Highly recommend!!
This place is awesome. You should definitely have a look inside if you have time in Rome. Remember to look up at the dome and marvel at how it was made so many years ago.

My favourite place in Rome and still breathtaking! It’s amazing seeing it emerge in its glory from the narrow city streets .. spectacular walking inside and seeing the sun streaming through the oculus as it has done for centuries previously
Turned up at mid afternoon on a Saturday and was able to walk straight in. Thoroughly recommend doing this after a guided tour of the forum and colosseum to understand how unique and precious the pantheon is.
Just as many of the other attractions in Rome the Pantheon is beautiful and very grand. Just be wary of what day of the week it is as Sundays will have limited access.

An amazing stop while in Rome. The history and architecture are amazing. It is free to enter. Area is centrally located to many restaurants and shops. This is not open at night.
"A fantastic place to see so much history, we timed it well as we walked in with no queue, when we came out there was a huge queue.
Download the free audio tour by Rick Steve's - well worth it!"
"This is free!! But, you can pay €15 for the audio tour. This was one of the best places we visited. Took so many pictures and we went back three times (our hotel was on Piazza della Rotonda). Don’t miss this!"
This is one of the highlights that you need to see in Rome. It is a truly beautiful original preserved ancient monument. It has a classical symmetrical design with a wonderful and functional interior.
"Beautiful on the side, although many tourists ignore the signs about appropriate apparel and behavior in a sacred church!"
"While you are wondering Rome’s streets, right in the city centre, you must visit this amazing monument. Built more than 2000 years ago, it is still standing graciously. The first thing to do, once you walked through its doors, it is to look up and...More"
I was amazed at how this was still so untouched by time. The inside blew me away! Take the audio guide. Walk around and see all the history it has to offer. Our girls were glad we went. The 10 yr old got bored aster...More
I love visiting the Pantheon everything I visit Roma. It’s astonishing structure and lively areas are my favorite. Quick to get in and out.
"Amazing how they built something like this so long ago. You stand in the center and are surrounded by alcoves that are dedicated to each religion, i.e Pan-theon. Stand in the center and peer out the hole, I can't remember what it was but there...More"
The Pantheon is a wonder of ancient architecture and must be seen! Plus it's free! Enjoy gelato on the plaza before or after.
"No tour you just walked in. Beautiful to see, crowded watch for pick pockets. Drink plenty of water during summer months"
I caught this at a good time because I think there's usually large lines. I was able to stroll in and walk around and take it in minutes. It's a beautiful structure to behold.
"Inside was really beautiful compared to the outside of the site.
Too many people made too much noise...
A place to visit for sure but not during summer."
"We loved the fact it is so beautiful and so old, rich history and a place you should make time to visit."
"Take a walking tour to see this, and you will walk through narrow streets and suddenly just walk out into the piazza dominated by this magnificent building. Seriously impressive from the outside - easy to access and free. The inside has a great collection of...More"
"Seeing the Pantheon in it’s almost perfectly preserved state, gives you a much better perspective about what the rest of Rome must have looked like. I would highly recommend visiting this first so that you can see all the different types and colors of marble...More"
"Greatly enjoyed seeing the Pantheon, especially after getting some of the history through our Walks of Italy tour of the Roman Forum the day before. I always marvel at the dome!"
"It is a very moving experience . We visit Rome a lot and we always visit the Pantheon. It is magical. It is still free to visit, but it is still considered a church, so one must dress appropriately."
"No hustle and bustle like all the other monuments in Rome, no entry fee and a much warmer experience . You forget how old the place is and the role it has played in the lives of the Romans and the city and being from...More"
"It is not ornate compared to many churches, but the sheer size and magnitudes of the cement dome is impressive."
"Nothing can prepare you for immensity of this building - you simply have to go in and experience it for yourself. The good news is that it is free, so just walk through the 20 tonne bronze doors (which can be moved with one hand)...More"
"But come at open. Really serene and impressive church that has amazing architecture and history. Later in the day, the line goes out in the plaza. The app with information came very handy."
Everyone warns you about the dress code at the vatican but they might not have warned you about the dress code at the pantheon. Our group wasn't looked at twice in the Vatican (where we covered up) but on the 95 degree (Fahrenheit) day we...More
"The place is just a wonder to see and be in, love it, visit every time we're in Rome. It's hard to believe it's as old as it is."
"What an absolutely great place! We visited on a fairly busy July afternoon, but had no wait to get in. Once inside, I felt slightly over-awed by the great sense of space and proportions. The domed roof is amazing, and looks almost modern. It’s just...More"
"By far the best part of my trip to Rome, I loved the Pantheon. It is such a lovely building and inside is so beautiful. Ladies must remember to cover their shoulders before they enter. It is so peaceful inside, even with the noise of...More"

"Pantheon is free to enter and is well worth a visit. We walked here after visiting the colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish steps and en route to Vatican City. It apparently has the largest unsupported dome in the world and is quite a building. Note however...More"
"One of the highlights of Rome. We found it particularly difficult to find as we took a wrong turn (the streets in rime are like a maze) but weren’t disappointed when we did find it.
The surrounding square has a number of small eateries and...More"
"Recently visited the Pantheon. Fantastic building and how they managed to build the dome, leaving the whole in the top. If you go inside listen to the video on machines inside. You will learn something that most people will not know. Not telling it's a...More"
"It is hard to truly take in the age of this place!
The staff do try to get people to be silent but at times it does get a little noisy, so if you want to pray just be aware of this."
What a surprise and very interesting design for a building. So amazing and the artwork inside was just incredible
"Absolutely grand, impressive and beautiful. A must see from the inside out. So glad that this monument has survived the winds of change and kept intact for so many years."
"In my view, the greatest architectural perfection there is! Go early to avoid lines, and have beautiful lighting. Go back again in the late afternoon too!"
"First time I visited Pantheon I was amazed with the building, especially the interior. The opening in the ceiling gives the place some special feeling with natural lite coming in. Second time I got there after visiting St Peters Basilica thinking I would be less...More"
"Worth to visit, because it's free and que goes very fast. Shoulders must be covered and tiny shorts not allowed."
"What a blessing it was that we were able (allowed) to stay for Mass at this beautiful historic holy space. We hadn't planned on it, but were there at the right time as tourists, and were able to stay as Catholic worshipers; no ticket required."
This is OBVIOUSLY a must see while visiting Rome. When we visited there wasn't much of a line and we got right in. What I didn't realize is that this is actually still a functioning church. Beautiful.
It is amazing and truly a must see. We went just before we had breakfast to skip the crowd and Mr Sun and it was worth waking up very early.
"We came here early in the morning and were able to enter quickly. We got many beautiful pictures. Avoid people offering ""cheap tours"" outside as they are likely ripping you off. Make sure you dress respectfully as we saw many people turned away for their...More"
Visited early in the morning & not many people there. Well worth seeing when in Rome. Not a big fan of visiting churches but this one was very unique.
Great place to visit. Another wow place in Rome. Easy access from anywhere and highly recommended. 😉
We went during busy time and was still fine. Think better early in the morning or later in day if you want to take a deeper dive and less traffic
"Considering how old the Pantheon is, it has held together well. Being a religious place, its not surprising the interior is made of marble.
Can become very crowded."
Such a cool building with amazing history. A must see while in Rome. Amazing to believe how long this place has been around.
"We have previously visited the Pantheon several times (2001 & 2011) and it is a glory to behold - the oculus especially and also its wonderful history.
However, where you used to be able to just walk up , pop in with no queue and...More"
"One of really impressive places in Rome, example of Roman Architecture! The size is really interesting.... i'd suggest to read a little bit the story as well before seeing it! Really recomended, as well as piazza rotonda for a nice break for a gelato!"
"No fee, no queues and some of the most outstanding architecture in Rome. A must visit both inside and out"
It was nice to see a bit of history and to imagine how thing were in those days but it was very crowded.
The line was long here during summer but it went very quickly. Inside was cool and bright and the oculus design was spectacular
Being in the Pantheon was an experience of another world. The fact that this was built around year 120 has me shocked. This is a necessity in Rome
This is really a special place. If you just watch the columns in the front you realize that a genius built it. Can you imagine roll those large piece of rocks from the Tiber to place it was constructed? Fascinating! How they built the dome...More

Such an incredible place to visit whilst in rome. The outside is just so grand and stunning. You must however go inside and take some time to look around. The whole in the roof is open and the inside gets wet with the rain. It’s...More
"Some truly beautiful architecture, a must visit when in Rome. No queue to get in unlike some other famous landmarks in Rome."
Truly astounding place built 2000 years ago! We had a fabulous tour of the Pantheon with Cristina with Cris Roman guide.
"Smaller that I thought it was going to be, located in a very busy area - constant warnings about pickpockets stopped me for enjoying it more."
"We visited the Pantheon on a Sunday and it was free admission to go inside. It is absolutely beautiful and incredible that it was built so long ago, yet looks perfect. Definitely go see while in Rome."
"This is in amazing shape for 2000 years old. Empty early in the morning but there was a line of a couple of hundred at 1pm. I learned from Rick Steves that the ""mote"" around the Pantheon is there because the level of the street...More"

Go to the Pantheon to see the dome inside and admire the level of architectural excellence it boasts of. There was a very short line and I think you have to be dressed respectfully to go inside but I was able to sit and kneel...More
We were on the walking tour (which I’d highly recommend) and from the outside I thought “what’s this place?” Once inside I was amazed. The structure is something else. How did they build this nearly 2000 years ago is beyond me. Highly recommend busing this...More
What a magnificent facility from the past preserved for all to see and admire. Could not help but wonder how these structure were constructed.
"the Pantheon is an ancient theatre type place, interesting, not overwhelming like Vatican, lots nice restaurants in area, easy walk as its center of Rome"
"Everything now days cost money to get inside to see, but not this landmark. It's rich of history, beautiful (understatement) and no charge to go inside."
An easily appreciated sight for someone with young children. No complex history just a very impressive building with the stunning oculus in the 3 roof
"I really enjoyed visiting the Pantheon. If you make it to Rome, it's a 'must see.' Free because it's a church, get in line and wander in, just please be quite. Notice the grates in the center of the floor to allow for rain."
an amazing structure wonder how they build it it is free to enter but it is well worth the time explore it
Really enjoyed our visit to the Pantheon. Read later that it is the one building that has been in permanent use since the time of the Roman Empire. After seeing some of Raphael masterpieces during our Time in Italy it was a surprise to find...More
"It doesn't take a long time to tour the Pantheon, but it is worth seeing. It was so beautiful and large."
Small wait to get in . Really impressed with it wow factor. They expect your knees to be covered bare it in mind when you visit. Plenty of drinking fountains nearby too.
"To think how old this structure is, and when you enter and see that dome - it can get quite crowdy so prepare to wait a few minutes to get in"
Great site. Visiting it is a must while in Rome. Just admireing the Dome is a thrill. A geat piece of architecture. Don’t miss it.
After many centuries the structure is standing. Inside of it are preserved a great collection of art and craftsmanship that will amaze you!
"A beautiful architecture, the dome as other Roman architecture is fascinating because of the sheer size, its huge, its fascinating to see a structure close to 2000 yrs old and still standing good. Compared to other Roman architecture this one is quite plain and not...More"
